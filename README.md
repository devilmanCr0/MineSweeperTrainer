# MineSweeperTrainer
A simple MineSweeper Trainer made for the RPISEC course: Malware Analysis
An excellent source for 1337, can be found [here](https://github.com/RPISEC/Malware)


# Features
*Well it's practically everything that's mentionned in the grading rubric for project 2 which you can check out [here](https://github.com/RPISEC/Malware/tree/master/Projects/Project_2)

**Notes
*ehh buggy and sloppy as hell but it could use some window API's to clean up the console when extracting mine layouts of different size 
*the hTools is a neat overview of Window's HANDLES, PROCESSES, and etc (self note)

**Hmm.. haxor haxor?**
*Big credits to [Guided Hacking](https://github.com/guided-hacking), an online forum that taught much - thank you.
